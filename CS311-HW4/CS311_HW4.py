#Investigate the following features or constructs as they pertain to Python:

# 1. interpretation
# 2. Boolean expressions
# 3. short circuit evaluation
# 4. numeric types
# 5. strings
# 6. arrays
# 7. lists
# 8. tuples
# 9. slices
# 10. index range checking
# 11. dictionaries
# 12. if statement
# 13. switch statement
# 14. for loop
# 15. while loop
# 16. indentation to denote code blocks
# 17. type binding
# 18. type checking
# 19. functions
# 20. one other feature - your choice

#For each of the above features you should do the following:

#   1. Write a short program or programs to investigate its use. You may combine more than one feature into a single program.
#   2. Explain how the feature works in Python and compare it to one or more languages with which you are familiar.
#   3. Critique the implementation or use of the feature or construct.

#Note: Some of the features above are not included in Python, in which case you should note that they are missing and critique the decision to leave them out.
#Finally, you should give an overall critique of Python.
