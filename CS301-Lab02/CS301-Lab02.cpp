// CS301-Lab02.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
/*Implement a function double getRoot (double x, int n). 
The function should return the nth root of x. 
Use the same algorithm as in the squareRoot function posted above. 
The difference is that instead of using mid*mid in the test you'll need mid to the power n in the test. 
That means you will need to write a helper function to take powers, which should also be recursive.

No use of <cmath> allowed. No loops.

Upload a .cpp with your getRoot function and a main that calls the function at least once.*/
